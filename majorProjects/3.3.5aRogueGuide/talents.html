      <h1 class="secIntro">Talent choices</h1>
      <p>Most of the build is set in stone and there are only couple places to be creative with majority of which are inside of the Assassination tree.</p>
      <div id="talentsImage"><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?talent#fhg00xxZMgVo0cxqru0xRt:hk0mcV" target="_blank" title="Click to go to the Talent Calculator"><img src="./Assets/Images/Build.jpg" alt="My PVE Combat Talents. Click to go to the Talent Calculator"/></a>
        <p>This is my build. It's pretty much the same as standart, however it may be changed based on your equipment and play style.</p>
      </div>
      <h2><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon Eviscerate"></span> Eviscerate</a> vs <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon Rupture"></span> Rupture</a></h2>
      <p>Depending on your finisher, you can either play with <a  href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14164" target="_blank">Improved Eviscerate 3/3</a> which will increase the damage of your <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a> by 20%, or with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51633" target="_blank">Blood Spatter 2/2</a> which will increase your <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> damage by 30% and leave you an extra tallent point to spend on <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14156" target="_blank">Ruthlessness.</a></p>
      <p>Most of the guides will tell you to play with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> in low gear and <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a> in high when you'll have more <abbr title="Armor Penertation Rating">ARP</abbr>, because it will deal more damage and the Earth is flat and blah, blah, blah. It's actually not true. After hours of testing I found out that even with full <abbr title="Armor Penertation Rating">ARP</abbr> cap <strong><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> deals more damage than <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a>.</strong> There are two reasons for that:
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> is 10 energy cheaper, hence, every 4th use allows you to hit one more time with the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48638" target="_blank">Sinister Strike</a> which is your main source of damage and <abbr title="Combo Points">CP</abbr>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48672" target="_blank">Rupture</a> deals additional 30% damage with Feral's or Arms' bleed buff which even without the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=56801" target="_blank">Rupture glyph</a> outdamages <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a> with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=56802" target="_blank">the glyph.</a></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>So what shoul you use then as your finisher? It depends on your playstyle. If you want to maximize your <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr>, you should play with both. Learn <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14164" target="_blank">Eviscerate 3/3</a> with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51633" target="_blank">Rutrure 2/2</a> and ignore <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14156" target="_blank">Ruthlessness</a> completly, it's not that profitable as may seem to be honest. However, as I said, it's not set in stone. You don't have to play with both finishers, in fact <strong>I still play with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14164" target="_blank">Improved Eviscerate 3/3</a> only.</strong> But why?</p>
      <p>Playing with both finishers will slightly increase your <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr> for sure but it requires more effort. You should remeber that finisher mooves aren't your main source of damage and sit on the very bottom of the recount window. I think that this small increase of damage is simply not worth the input effort. However, this information is still here just in case you want to go absolutely tryhard and squeeze out of your class as much <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr> as you only can.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon VilePoisons"></span> Vile Poisons</a> vs <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon InstantPosion"></span> Improved Poisons</a></h2>
      <p>After picking your finisher with leveling <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14137" target="_blank">Lethality 5/5</a> which is must have, you are left with 5 points to spend in Assasination tree. Poisons are one of your main sources of damage so the best place for these points is poisons talents. <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Poisons</a> will increase the actual damage of your poisons, whereas <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank">Improved Poisons</a> will increase the chance and the amount of procs poisons' procs.</p>
      <p>Most people take <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Posions</a> for 1/3 and spend the rest in the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank">Improved Poisons</a>, which is not bad, but I'd reccomend to ommit <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Poisons</a> completely and take <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank">Improved Poisons</a> for 5/5. It'll allow your 5 <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=43233" target="_blank">Deadly Poison</a> stacks stack faster which is very usefull in the beggining of the combat and after the change of targets. It also decreases the inner cooldown of your <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=43231" target="_blank">Instant Poison</a> which will make it proc more often to. In general, fully caped <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=14117" target="_blank">Improved Poisons</a> will deal more damage than <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Poisons</a> 1/3.</p>
      <p><strong>Spending more than 1 point into <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=16513" target="_blank">Vile Posions</a> is a mistake, very minor but still. Poisons themselves will deal more damage, but the number of applies will decrease which will affect your <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr>.</strong></p>
      <h2><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13964" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon Swords"></span> Swords</a> vs <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13807" target="_blank"><span class="mIcon Daggers"></span> Daggers</a></h2>
      <p>This part is dedicated to some varieties in Combat tree which aren't many. The only thing you can change here are your weapon talents. I often see people with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13964" target="_blank">Hack and Slash 5/5</a> in their build who don't have good swords or axes yet so they wear daggers instead. Plese don't do it, it's waste of your skill points and your <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr>. Don't be afraid to change your build based on the weapons you yse, it's not that expencive. <strong>Take <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13807" target="_blank">Close Quarters Combat 5/5</a> if you play with daggers or <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13803" target="_blank">Mace Specialization 5/5</a> if you use maces.</strong> It will help.</p>

    <section id="glyphs">
      <h1 class="secIntro">Glyph Choices</h1>
      <div id="glyphsImage"><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?talent#fhg00xxZMgVo0cxqru0xRt:hk0mcV" target="_blank" title="Click to go to the Glyph Calculator"><img src="Assets/Images/Glyphs.jpg" alt="My PVE Combat Glyphs. Click to go to the Talent Calculator"/></a>
        <p>These are my glyphs. There are many like them, but these are mine.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Major</h2>
      <p>Your major glyphs should consist of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=42972" target="_blank"><span class="bIcon SinisterStrike"></span> Glyph of Sinister Strike</a>
          <p>The most essential glyph for every Combat Rogue. <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48638" target="_blank">Sinister Strike</a> is your main and only Combo Point generator which you'll use during the whole fight and it's simply good when it gives you more than one <abbr title="Combo Point">CP</abbr>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=42961" target="_blank"><span class="bIcon Eviscerate"></span> Glyph of Eviscerate</a>
          <p>You will never change this glyph despite the build you play for one simple reason: there is nothing worse than an <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=48668" target="_blank">Eviscerate</a> without crit.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=42954" target="_blank"><span class="bIcon AdrenalinRush"></span> Adrenalin Rush</a> or<a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=45762" target="_blank"><span class="bIcon KillingSpree" id="listitemFix"></span> Killing Spree</a>
          <p>The last glyph is for your burst. <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=45762" target="_blank">Glyph of Killing Spree</a> is what most people take here, because <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">Killing Spree</a> deals so much damage in a short period of time which is good for burst. But the true is, <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">Killing Spree</a> is often not that usefull without <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13877" target="_blank">Blade Flurry</a>. It may jump over the slime in the fight with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=36627" target="_blank">Rotface</a>, or on the <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=37813" target="_blank">Lord Saurfang's</a> trash, or on the one of the inactive Princes before <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=37955" target="_blank">Blood Queen Lana'thel</a>, or on the trash with Val'kyres on <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?npc=36597" target="_blank">The Lich King</a>, or hell knows where else. You got the point. <strong>It might deal ablsolutely no effective damage</strong>. <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13877" target="_blank">Blade Flurry</a> negates this aspect and allows your <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">Killing Spree</a> to deal even more damage when there are many targets around. Using your <abbr title="Blade Flurry"><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=13877" target="_blank">BF</a></abbr> before <abbr title="Killing Spree"><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?spell=51690" target="_blank">KS</a></abbr> makes it effective at all times. Since they have the same cooldoun, I see no reason to change it with <a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=45762" target="_blank">the glyph</a>.</p>
          <p>That's why I use the <strong><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=42954" target="_blank">Glyph of Adrenaline Rush</a> which decreases your downtime during the burst phase</strong> by givving you 5 more seconds of almost unlimited energy.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Other major glyphs are almost useless.</strong></p>
      <h2>Minor</h2>
      <p>Minor glyphs are not as important, but I'll go over them too.
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=43379" target="_blank"><span class="bIcon Sprint"></span> Glyph of Blurred Speed</a>
          <p>It's cool to have. Sometimes it helps to mount up in the water or get somewhere faster.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=43378" target="_blank"><span class="bIcon Kick"></span> Glyph of Safe Fall</a>
          <p>This glyph will save your life a bunch of times, belive me.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://wotlkdb.com/?item=43380" target="_blank"><span class="bIcon Vanish"></span> Glyph of Vanish</a>
          <p>Improved Vanish will help you to retreat in case of "something goes wrong" situations.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Other minor glyphs are almost useless.</strong></p>
